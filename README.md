# Router_1x3
This project demonstrates the design, RTL implementation, and verification of a 1x3 packet-based router using Verilog HDL. The router accepts data from a single input and routes it to one of three output ports based on a 2-bit destination address. Each output is buffered using a FIFO to handle asynchronous data flow and congestion control.
